            "\n",
            "* **`GameState`:**  Manages the game's state.  It holds a reference to the `Dungeon` and the player's current `Room`.  It also tracks visited rooms (though the implementation of `visited` is unclear from the diagram – it may be a `HashSet` as indicated, stored as a member variable).  The `initialize` method sets up the game with a given `Dungeon`.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`CommandFactory`:**  A factory class responsible for creating `Command` objects from user input strings.  This decouples command parsing from command execution.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`Command`:** Represents a player's command (e.g., \"go north\").  It contains the direction and has an `execute` method to process the command.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`Dungeon`:** Represents the game world. It's a collection of `Room` objects, accessed via a `Hashtable` (likely using room names as keys). It also stores the game's title and the entry `Room`.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`Room`:** Represents a location within the `Dungeon`. It has a name, description, and a collection of `Exit` objects defining paths to other rooms.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`Exit`:** Represents an exit from a `Room`. It specifies a direction, the source `Room`, and the destination `Room`.\n",

            "**Relationships:**\n",

            "\n",
            "* **`GameState ~visited`:**  Suggests a relationship where `GameState` uses a data structure (probably `HashSet`) named `visited` to track visited rooms.  The notation is slightly unusual; a more standard notation would be `GameState -visited: HashSet<Room>`.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`main -buildSampleDungeon() : Dungeon`:** The `main` class creates a `Dungeon`.\n",
            "\n",

            "* **`Dungeon «uses» Room`:** A `Dungeon` contains multiple `Room` objects.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **`GameState`'s `visit` and `hasBeenVisited` methods:** These methods are described as being part of `GameState`, but are oddly marked with a tilde (~). This suggests they are static methods, which doesn't make much sense in this context.  They should probably be instance methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Data Structures:**  While a `Hashtable` is mentioned for `Dungeon`, using a more modern `HashMap` (or equivalent) would generally be preferred.\n",
